Hello world! This is my first blog post using MDX. I'm excited to share my thoughts, 
projects, and experiences with you.

MDX lets me write content in Markdown while also using JavaScript expressions.
For example: {new Date().getFullYear()} is the current year.

Stay tuned for more posts coming soon!
