# Here is a brief overview of the projects I have worked on:

## C++ Metrics Publisher

Developed a C++ protocol metrics publisher to tail multiple log files, parsing
key-value pairs with custom decoders and generating data frames for 5.8
billion+ messages per day. The system provided real-time performance
monitoring for trading gateways.

## Python Orchestration Layer

Built a Python orchestration layer with C++ bindings to aggregate data frames, transform them to JSON, and stream real-time metrics to Elasticsearch and Grafana dashboards. This enabled sub-second latency monitoring for trading operations.

## Concurrent Python Kafka Consumer

Developed a concurrent Python Kafka consumer leveraging asyncio and
multiprocessing to process 500+ million messages in 5 minutes, achieving a 9x
speed improvement. Implemented intelligent partitioning and robust error
handling for continuous market operation.

## FastAPI Alert Proxy

Created a Python FastAPI proxy server integrating OpenTelemetry alerts with an
internal messaging platform via RESTful API. Reduced alert-to-notification
latency by 60% through asynchronous processing and contextual enrichment.
